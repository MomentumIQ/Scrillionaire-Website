description: Data is Localized. Private Data is processed locally. Ranking Data is not linked to User ID. Server components encrypt any user data that is stored with users public key. User data is deleted once user completes client side retrieval and storage.  Private Ranking Data is only a users Big Number and its global ranking. Public Ranking is only a users Big Number and its ranking among other public users Big Number.
problem: Users do not want us to sell their data in order to deliver our services and do not trust that we are not selling their data if we store their data.
solution: Process as much user data locally on device and store as little data on our servers as possible. When we store data, store it anonymously
stretch_feature: Open source backend services so that users can have assurance that we donâ€™t look at their data beyond the items they want to make public (Big Number Ranking or possibly allowing them to make specific pieces of data like transactions or historical Big Number available).
