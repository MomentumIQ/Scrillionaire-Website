description: The Levels feature is a sort of game like progression where users have to meet and maintain certain criteria in order to level up. Users are presented visually with their current level, their progress toward the next level and the tasks left for them to complete in order to move on to the next level. Users go down in level if they do not continue to maintain any level’s requirements. The levels are aimed specifically at improving users financial health.  The Achievements feature is a sort of game like achievements system. Users are awarded Achievements for completing specific challenges like “Spend <25% of income in April” or “Increase savings rate by 25% in Q3”. These Achievements are presented to the user as tappable icons that expand to full pages when tapped giving descriptions of the challenge, the date you received the achievement and a quote from a financial guru.
