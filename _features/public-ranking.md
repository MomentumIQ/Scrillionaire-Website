description: Public Ranking allows users to opt into ranking where they are only ranked against other publicly ranked users. These rankings are made public for users to share. Users receive links to share their public profile. Their public profile is a static page where they can share their big number and/or their rank. Both are optional and can be toggled by the user. The interface for their public rank includes links to the public profiles of the people above and below them as well as the top 7.
problem: Users are not able to share their financial status with other people in a verifiable fashion that also protects their specific financial data. 
solution: Allow users to authorize us to share their public ranking data (Big Number and Public Rank).
stretch_feature: Robust public profiles with historical ranking data and verified large purchases.
