        <h5 class="text-muted"><p>Your privacy is important to us. It is MomentumIQ Inc.’s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, MomentumIQ, and its associated services.</p>

<p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service.</p>

<p>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app.</p>

<p>This policy is effective as of 3 February 2022.</p>

<p>Last updated: 3 February 2022</p>

<p>Information We Collect</p>

<p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p>

<p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services.</p>

<p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and its associated services.</p>

<p>Log Data</p>

<p>When you access our servers via our app, we may automatically log the standard data provided by your device. It may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device type and version, your activity within the app, time and date, and other details about your usage.</p>

<p>Additionally, when you encounter certain errors while using the app, we automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.</p>

<p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.</p>

<p>Personal Information</p>

<p>We may ask for personal information — for example, when you submit content to us or when you contact us — which may include one or more of the following:</p>

<p>Name
Email
Phone/mobile number
Home/mailing address</p>

<p>Sensitive Information</p>

<p>“Sensitive information” or “special categories of data” is a subset of personal information that is given a higher level of protection. Examples of sensitive information include information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records, health information, or biometric information.</p>

<p>The types of sensitive information that we may collect about you include:</p>

<p>Financial</p>

<p>We will not collect sensitive information about you without first obtaining your consent, and we will only use or disclose your sensitive information as permitted, required, or authorized by law.</p>

<p>User-Generated Content</p>

<p>We consider “user-generated content” to be materials (text, image and/or video content) voluntarily supplied to us by our users for the purpose of publication on our platform, website or re-publishing on our social media channels. All user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials.</p>

<p>Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of publication will be public after posting (and subsequent review or vetting process). Once published, it may be accessible to third parties not covered under this privacy policy.</p>

<p>Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information</p>

<p>We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you.</p>

<p>Collection and Use of Information</p>

<p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our website:</p>

<p>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content
Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies
When you mention us on social media</p>

<p>We may collect, hold, use, and disclose information for the following purposes, and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>

<p>to provide you with our app and platform’s core features and services
to enable you to customize or personalize your experience of our website</p>

<p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, If you consent to us accessing your social media profiles, we may combine information sourced from those profiles with information received from you directly to provide you with an enhanced experience of our app and services.</p>

<p>Security of Your Personal Information</p>

<p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>

<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.</p>

<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services.
For example, ensuring you do not make your personal information publicly available via our platform.</p>

<p>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</p>

<p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information such as an email address when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.</p>

<p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p>

<p>Children’s Privacy</p>

<p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13.</p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any parties who acquire us may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to use your personal information according to this policy, which they will be required to assume as it is the basis for any ownership or use rights we have over such information.</p>

<p>Limits of Our Policy</p>

<p>Changes to This Policy</p>

<p>At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable practices, or legislative or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post the changes here and on our website.</p>

<p>Do Not Track</p>

<p>Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.</p>

<p>We adhere to the standards outlined in this privacy policy, ensuring we collect and process personal information lawfully, fairly, transparently, and with legitimate, legal reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>CCPA-permitted financial incentives</p>

<p>In accordance with your right to non-discrimination, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels for the goods or services we provide.</p>

<p>Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to the value of your personal information, and we will provide written terms that describe clearly the nature of such an offer. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
