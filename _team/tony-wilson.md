Rocking a 20+ year career marathon in the wild world of software engineering and still loving every bit of it! From traversing digital bullets in Internet Security to the waves of Online Investing, I've ventured through Banking, Media, and Sales Enablement with a grin plastered on my face. I'm all about teaming up with poly-skilled engineers who not only put customers first but also geek out over new tech and treat software like an art form.

When I'm not knee-deep in leading teams, you'll find me crushing levels on PlayStation, hacking away at the golf course (without keeping score, because who needs that kind of pressure?), bluffing my way through Texas Holdâ€™em poker nights, binge-watching enough TV shows and movies to rival Netflix, and hunting down the next mouth-watering culinary adventure. Life's too short not to have a blast, both in and out of the tech realm!
